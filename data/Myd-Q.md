## L/N - 1 :- Avoid Unnecessary Loops
In https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L252-L261

The loop iterating over `configuredTokenContracts` could be optimized by breaking out of the loop as soon as the relevant token contract is found. This would improve performance, especially if there are many token contracts configured.
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < configuredTokensLength; i++) {
    address tokenContract = configuredTokenContracts[i];
    if (lockedTokens[msg.sender][tokenContract].quantity > 0) {
        // ... (existing code)
        break; // Exit the loop after processing the first relevant token contract
    }
}
```
#### 1.1 Use Modifiers for Access Control
Instead of checking the notPaused condition within the function, consider using a modifier to enforce this access control. This would improve code readability and maintainability.
```solidity
modifier notPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}

function setLockDuration(uint256 _duration) external notPaused { /* ... */ }
```
## L/N - 2 :- unexpected behavior `_reconfigure` function
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L65-L83

The function assumes that the `configStorage` contract has been properly initialized and contains valid addresses for the required contracts (`AccountManager`, `MigrationManager`, `SnuggeryManager`, and `NFTOverlord`). If any of these addresses are not set or are set to an incorrect value, the function will assign an invalid address to the respective contract variable.

While this may not necessarily cause a bug or error during the execution of the `_reconfigure` function itself, it could lead to issues when these contract variables are used in other parts of the code. Attempting to interact with an invalid contract address could result in failed transactions, reverted calls, or other unexpected behavior.

Consider adding input validation checks within the `_reconfigure` function to ensure that the retrieved addresses are valid and non-zero before assigning them to the respective variables. For example:
```solidity
function _reconfigure() internal {
    address accountManagerAddress = configStorage.getAddress(StorageKey.AccountManager);
    require(accountManagerAddress != address(0), "Invalid AccountManager address");
    accountManager = IAccountManager(accountManagerAddress);

    address migrationManagerAddress = configStorage.getAddress(StorageKey.MigrationManager);
    require(migrationManagerAddress != address(0), "Invalid MigrationManager address");
    migrationManager = IMigrationManager(migrationManagerAddress);

    // ... (repeat for other contract addresses)
}
```
## L/N - 3 :- Redundant Checks
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L311-L398

The code checks if the `_lockDuration` is within the allowed range twice, once before calculating the number of NFTs and again after. This redundancy could be eliminated by combining the checks or refactoring the logic.

#### 3.1 :- Lack of Input Validation
The function does not validate the input parameters, such as checking if `_tokenContract` is a valid contract address or if `_quantity` is greater than zero. Adding input validation checks can improve the code's robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.

## L/N - 4 :- Separate the condition and loop logic for better readability
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L506-L526

The current code combines the condition check and the loop logic in a single `if` statement. Consider separating them into two separate blocks for better readability and maintainability:
```solidity
if (usdUpdateProposal.approvalsCount >= APPROVE_THRESHOLD && usdUpdateProposal.disapprovalsCount < DISAPPROVE_THRESHOLD) {
    uint256 numContractsToUpdate = usdUpdateProposal.contracts.length;
    if (numContractsToUpdate > 0) {
        for (uint256 i; i < numContractsToUpdate; i++) {
            // Loop logic here
        }
    }
    delete usdUpdateProposal;
}
```
This separation makes it easier to understand the different parts of the code and potentially allows for better code reuse or extension in the future.

#### 4.1 Consider using a more efficient loop mechanism:
Instead of using a traditional for loop, you could use a more gas-efficient loop mechanism like unchecked loops or uint256 iterator variables. This can help save gas costs, especially for large arrays.

#### 4.2 Validate input data:
Before processing the `usdUpdateProposal`, consider adding input validation checks to ensure that the proposal data is valid and consistent. For example, you could check if the contracts array is not empty and if the `proposedPrice` is within an expected range.

#### 4.3Use events for better transparency and monitoring:
In addition to the `USDPriceUpdated` event, consider emitting events for other important state changes or actions within the function. This can improve transparency, monitoring, and debugging capabilities.

## L/N - 5 :- Use a more efficient loop
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L461-L487

Instead of using a `traditional` for loop, you could use a `for...in` loop or a `while` loop to iterate over the `configuredTokenContracts` array. This could potentially improve performance, especially for large arrays.

## L/N - 6 :- Conditional Assignment
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L275-L294

Instead of using an if-else statement to assign the lockRecipient variable, you could use a ternary operator for a more concise and readable expression:
```solidity
address lockRecipient = _onBehalfOf != address(0) ? _onBehalfOf : msg.sender;
```
#### 5.1 Input Validation
Consider adding input validation checks for the `_tokenContract` and `_quantity` parameters to ensure they are valid and within expected ranges. This can help prevent potential errors or vulnerabilities.

## L/N - 7 :- Unnecessary Variable Assignment
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L288-L291

The line `address lockRecipient = msg.sender;` is redundant since the value is immediately overwritten if `_onBehalfOf` is not the zero address. This could be simplified by initializing `lockRecipient` with the ternary operator.

## L/N - 8 :- Error Handling
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L401-L411

Instead of using revert statements with custom error messages, it would be better to use Solidity's built-in error handling mechanism with custom errors. This approach improves gas efficiency and code readability.
```solidity
error InsufficientLockAmountError();
error TokenStillLockedError();

// ...

if (lockedToken.quantity < _quantity) revert InsufficientLockAmountError();
if (lockedToken.unlockTime > uint32(block.timestamp)) revert TokenStillLockedError();
```

## L/N - 9 :- Unnecessary Casting
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L410-L411

The cast `uint32(block.timestamp)` is unnecessary since `block.timestamp` is already a `uint256` type. Removing the cast can improve code readability and maintainability.
```solidity
if (lockedToken.unlockTime > block.timestamp) revert TokenStillLockedError();
```

## L/N - 10 :- Conditional Assignment
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L287-L291

Instead of using an if-else statement to assign the `lockRecipient` variable, you could use a ternary operator for a more concise and readable expression:
```solidity
address lockRecipient = _onBehalfOf != address(0) ? _onBehalfOf : msg.sender;
```

## L/N - 11 :- Use Explicit Data Location for Structs
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-munchables/blob/57dff486c3cd905f21b330c2157fe23da2a4807d/src/managers/LockManager.sol#L115-L127

When dealing with structs, it's a good practice to specify the data location explicitly (memory or storage) to avoid potential issues and improve code clarity.
```solidity
ConfiguredToken storage _tokenData
```
